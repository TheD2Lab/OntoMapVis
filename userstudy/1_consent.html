            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>This is a study conducted by Sella Bae under supervision of Dr. Bo Fu from D2 Data Visualization Lab in the Department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science at California State University of Long Beach.</p>
            
            <h5>Purpose and Objectives</h5>
            <p>Ontologies are classifications of conceptualizations where information is modeled in structured representations.<br>
                Ontology mapping is the activity of associating concepts belonging to different ontologies.<br>
                The goal of this research is to investigate the extent to which visualization can facilitate users in the process of evaluating ontology mapping results.</p>
            
            <h5>Importance of this Research</h5>
            <p>This research tackles a novel topic that has not received much attention in the field of ontology mapping. It is expected that the findings from this research will offer insights to the use of visualizations in ontology mapping and advances the state of the art in this field.</p>
            
            <h5>Participants Selection</h5>
            <p>No prior knowledge of ontology or ontology mapping is required. If you are eighteen years of age or older, we would like to invite you to participate in this study.</p>
            
            <h5>What is involved</h5>
            <p>If you consent to voluntarily participate in this research, you will take part in a short tutorial on ontology, ontology mapping and visualization. You will be asked to evaluate a set of mapping results assisted by different types of visualization. You will be asked to express your satisfaction with the visualization at the end of the session by taking part in interviews and filling out questionnaires. An eye tracker will be used to observe your interaction with the visualization by recording gaze data.<br>
                This study takes place in Room ECS-211 in the Department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science Building, California Statue University of Long Beach. </p>
            
            <h5>Inconvenience</h5>
            <p>Each study is estimated to take approximately 1.5 hours of your time.<br> 
            If you consent to voluntarily participate in this research, you are advised to set aside at least 2 hours to accommodate any eventual delays.</p>
            
            <h5>Risks</h5>
            <p>There are no known or anticipated risks to you by participating in this research.</p>
            
            <h5>Benefits</h5>
            <p>The potential benefits of your participation in this research include contributing to the understanding of visualizations in ontology mapping and to the body of knowledge in this field.</p>
            
            <h5>Voluntary Participation</h5>
            <p>Your participation in this research is entirely voluntary. You may withdraw at any time without any consequences or any explanation. If you do withdraw from the study, your data will be destroyed permanently. </p>
            
            <h5>Compensation</h5>
            <p>...</p>
            
            <h5>Anonymity</h5>
            <p>All participants and the data generated in this study will be anonymzed. </p>
            
            <h5>Confidentiality</h5>
            <p>Your confidentiality and the confidentiality of the data will be protected by the anonymity procedures enforced in this study. Storage of the data is completely protected and access to the data is restricted to the principal investigator exclusively.</p>
            
            <h5>Dissemination of Results</h5>
            <p>It is anticipated that the results of this study will be shared with others in the following ways: scientific websites, articles, and presentations. Where used in academic publications, all data will be aggregated and no personally identifiable information will be published. </p>
            
            <h5>Disposal of Data</h5>
            <p>Data from this study will be safely kept for the duration of this study. Data will be disposed of permanently after the completion of this study. </p>
