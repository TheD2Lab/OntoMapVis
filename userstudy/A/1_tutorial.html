            <h4>What's an <b>ontology</b>?</h4>
            <p>In computer science, an ontology is a specification of conceptualizations. <br>
            Ontologies are used to capture knowledge about some domain of interest. <br>
            An ontology describes the concepts in the domain and also the relationships that hold between those concepts.</p>
            </p>
            <p>In the example ontology below, concpets about pizza is shown as an indented list.</p>

            </div>

            <h4>What's <b>ontology mapping</b>?</h4>
            <p>Ontologies are typically created by different authors. As a result, the concepts and structures in them will differ even if these ontologies describe the same domain of interest.  <br>
            Ontology mapping generates correspondences between concepts belonging to different ontologies. </p>
            
            <p><b class="font_color_primary">Mapped concepts means that they are equivalent in their meaning and can be used interchangably.</b></p>

            <h4>What will I see?</h4>
            <p>You will see a <b>mapping visualization</b> that represents mappings of concepts in two ontologies as <b>linked lines</b>.</p>

            <h4>What should I do?</h4>
            <p>In this study, you will be shown mappings between an ontology pair. <br>
            Your goal is to determine if these exact mappings are correct and complete.</p>
