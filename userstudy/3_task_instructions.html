        <div style="width:800px">
            <h5>What to expect?</h5>
            <p>You will be given two tasks, and a set of questionnaires to fill out at the end of each task.  <br>
                Each task involves a different ontology pair, where one pair describes organism (in task one) and the other pair describes conferences (in task two).<br>
                There are right and wrong answers in each task, you are encouraged to do the best you can and as fast as you can be with a task. </p>
            <p>In each task, you will be shown a list of exact mappings between the given ontology pair. <br>
                Your goal is to evaluate these mappings by determining whether they are correct and complete, i.e. when you finish the evaluation, you have 
            <ul>
                <li>identified the wrong mappings; and </li>
                <li>added any additional new mappings that may exist between the given ontology pair. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Here's a reminder - exact mappings are those that you are highly confident the mapped concepts can be used interchangeably from one ontology to the other, which should be determined based on how these concepts are structured in the given ontologies. </p>
            
            <h5>How are mappings presented?</h5>
            <p>The mappings will be presented to you in two different types of visualization and in a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet will contain two parts. <br>
                You need to determine whether you think the given mappings are correct or not in part 1 (e.g. Figure 2). <br>
                You need to determine the completeness of part 1 by creating and adding new mappings to part 2 (e.g. Figure 3). </p>
            <p>For example, in Figure 2, "Queen Elizabeth" and "University" belonging to ontology O are mapped to "The Queen" and "College" belonging to ontology O' respectively. You need to indicate whether you think these mappings are correct or not by selecting the appropriate answer: either "Yes" or "No" for each row. You do not need to correct the mappings here, just click on the arrows of the cells and select your answers from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2. 
As you navigate through the classes in the given ontologies to complete part 1, you may correct the wrong mappings or add new mappings (i.e. ones that are not already included in part 1) to part 2, as shown in Figure 3. Your goal for part 2 is to ensure that once you've completed the task, the spreadsheet will contain all the exact mappings between the given ontology pair. </p>
