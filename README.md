### D2 Data Visualization Lab
# Matrix-based Data Visualization of Ontology Mapping

## Todo
- [ ] Create a prototype of mapping visualization with conference dataset
### Break it down
1. Prep the data
	- [x] Convert .owl and .rdf to .json
	- [ ] Use JenaAPI to extract only the classes from ontologies and Save it in simplest json.
2. Visualize an ontology as an indented tree 
	- [x] Show a list of classes from an ontology in .owl file
	- [ ] Make the subclasses indented
	- [ ] Make the items collapsible
3. Baseline mapping visualization
	- [ ] Visualize two ontologies side by side in mirrored
	- [ ] Draw lines for the class mappings from .rdf file
4. Matrix mapping visualization
	- [ ] Draw a matrix
	- [ ] Visualize two ontologies on the column/row headers
	- [ ] Mark cells for the class mappings from .rdf file

## Later Todo
1. Interactive features for better visualization..
2. ..
